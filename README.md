4. **Unknown Errors:** 30 jobs

## Incident Analysis

### Example Incident: Data Validation Error

**Incident ID:** INC-20241203-003

**Date and Time:** 2024-12-03 10:15:00 (UTC)

**Job ID:** JOB-12345

**Status:** Resolved

### Incident Description

A data validation error occurred during the execution of a data ingestion job. The job failed due to a mismatch in the expected data format.

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue was traced to an incorrect data format in the source file, which did not match the expected schema.

### Resolution

1. Identified the incorrect data format and corrected it.
2. Updated the validation rules to handle similar discrepancies in the future.
3. Restarted the job and monitored its successful completion.

### Preventive Measures

- Enhanced data validation rules to handle a wider range of data formats.
- Implemented additional checks to identify and correct data format issues before job execution.

### Trends Identified

- **Network Issues:** Increased frequency during peak hours. Recommended to review network capacity and optimize data transfer processes.
- **Data Validation Errors:** Common in new data sources. Recommended to enhance validation rules and provide training for data providers.
- **Resource Constraints:** Occurred during high-load periods. Recommended to review resource allocation and implement auto-scaling.

## Recommendations

1. **Network Optimization:** Review and optimize network capacity to handle peak loads.
2. **Enhanced Data Validation:** Improve validation rules and provide training for data providers to reduce errors.
3. **Resource Management:** Implement auto-scaling policies to handle high-load periods and prevent resource constraints.
